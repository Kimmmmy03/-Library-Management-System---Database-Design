## Introduction  
The **Library Management System** is a prototype database solution designed to support and automate key functions within a library environment. This project focuses on the database design phase of the **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** and is intended to model real-world operations such as:

- Borrowing books and media  
- Managing patron access via library cards  
- Tracking acquisitions and library materials  
- Generating reports and forms for data access  

The prototype was designed using **Microsoft Access** with the help of **Form Wizard** and **Report Wizard**, and an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** was developed to model the system structure.

## Problem Statement & Objectives

### Problem Statement
An instituteâ€™s library serves students and employees by providing access to a collection of books and media. The library requires a structured database to manage:

- Book and media circulation  
- Borrower tracking  
- Staff operations such as acquisitions and cataloging  
- Accurate and efficient reporting  

### Objectives
- Design an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for the Library Management System  
- Generate user interface **Forms** using Form Wizard  
- Create departmental **Reports** using Report Wizard  
- Apply best practices in **database normalization and design**

---

## Deliverables

1. **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
   - Models entities such as `Books`, `Members`, `Borrowing`, `Librarians`, and `Branches`  
   - Captures relationships like borrowing activity, item availability, and patron-librarian interactions  

2. **User Interface Forms**  
   - Developed using **Form Wizard** in Microsoft Access  
   - Allow library staff to input and manage data such as book details, member registration, and borrowing records  

3. **Departmental Reports**  
   - Created using **Report Wizard**  
   - Provide summaries of borrowings, overdue items, member activities, and inventory status
